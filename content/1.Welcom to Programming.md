# [Introduction to programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-with-javascript/lecture/qUwaB/introduction-to-programming)

> [!INFO] Computer Program
> A computer program is just a series of instructions based on some rules. These instructions tell a computer what to do under some specific circumstances and they are written to perform a specific set of tasks. 

All these programs are called ==software== and are in one way or another. Running on physical machines which are referred to as ==hardware==. 

## Programming

Programming is simply the process of writing the steps a computer needs to take to complete a certain task. To program these instructions, we use programming languages. 

> [!INFO] Programming language
> A programming language is sort of like a bridge that we use to facilitate communication between computers and people. 

For a computer to understand a programming language, it needs to save it somewhere in its random access memory. ==RAM== or on a disk in ==binary code==, which is represented by a series of zeros and ones. 

The binary code is a representation of machine language that a computer can understand. All of the zeros and ones in binary language represent electrical switches. 

## CPU

A computer's central processing unit, or CPU can comprehend these binary electrical signals and update itself accordingly. 

This machine language, with its series of zeros and ones, is known as a low level language because it's closer to being understood by a computer's CPU. 

There are also high level languages such as JavaScript, that needs to be interpreted, that is converted to binary code that a CPU will be able to work with.

# Why JavaScript?

> [!INFO] JavaScript
> JavaScript is a language that builds interactivity into web pages. It is literally the language of the web. 

Almost every website runs JavaScript in some form or another. The reason for this is the fact that since its very inception In 1995, JavaScript has been the main way to interact with web pages on the client side, the front and side of websites and web applications. 

Using JavaScript updates are displayed in real time on our devices. Some common examples include interactive maps and ==client side form validation==.

Over the years, there have been some alternatives to JavaScript, such as ==VBScript== and more recently TypeScript. But even typescript compiles down to JavaScript so browsers can understand it. 

Since JavaScript is one of the most widely available and frequently used methods for interacting with the browser on the client side, the language became immensely popular. 

## what is it that makes JavaScript so integral to modern browsers?

JavaScript is currently the only computer language that allows us to directly interact with our web pages dynamically on the client. It's baked into the browser. 

Its enduring popularity is down to the rules of backwards compatibility, which states that all websites that were built in the past still need to work today. 

So removing JavaScript from the browser would effectively render millions of websites completely useless. This means that JavaScript is in the unique position of being one of several central pillars of web development. 

## Why to use?

One of the main reasons that developers use JavaScript is because of how easy it is to use. There are many programming languages where a newcomer needs to do a substantial amount of prep work to even get set up and ready to learn. 

However, with JavaScript it's as simple as opening the browser's developer tools and navigating to the console tab because every browser has a ==JavaScript engine== built in and you can interact with it using the ==console==. 

Another reason to learn and use JavaScript is because as we saw earlier, it's everywhere. JavaScript is used in almost every website there is. 

- It's used on the client side of sites as plain JavaScript also known as ==vanilla JavaScript==. 
- It fuels a myriad of JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue, and D3.
- It's also used on the server as Node.js and more recently Deno.
- Another reason why people often choose JavaScript is that it's considered one of the more accessible programming languages. 
- It also has a wide development community to offer help and guidance.

# [Programming in JavaScript](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-with-javascript/lecture/mWmek/programming-in-javascript)

On the server, it can be used to power up websites, communicate with databases, and provide a native fields to web apps. It's used to build mobile apps using technologies like React Native and it's used to program devices known as the Internet of Things. 

In the early 2000s, different companies built Internet browsers and were referred to as browser vendors. However, with different browsers came different behaviors with various discrepancies between other browsers. This resulted in developers sometimes having to write separate JavaScript code for different browsers. 

Out of this frustration, several projects appeared trying to solve this compatibility problem. One such project managed to solve these issues and it was a library named ==jQuery==. Using this library, all a developer needed was to import jQuery and write code using its features. This code would then work across all browsers. At the time, it was like magic, as it was such a great solution to the problem of incompatibility and jQuery became the most popular JavaScript library for well over a decade. 

However, as the web and the way we code kept evolving, new problems appeared, and soon enough, new solutions to those problems needed to be built. Once such solution was React, which came out in 2011 and it had a considerable effect on the way we think about websites and how we build them. React, solved many of the issues associated with creating, updating and maintaining complex websites. 

Soon, many other technologies appeared attempting to do the same. These include Knockout, Backbone, Angular, Ember, Vue, Alpine, and others. 

With millions of websites containing JavaScript code from different versions and libraries, there is a lot of old code. This is known as a ==legacy code==. While you probably won't use jQuery to build a modern website today, you might still come across it in a project that is still actively running. 

> [!TIP]
> Sometimes beginners think they have to learn or even master all the different technologies associated with JavaScript. However, that's not really necessary. To be a well-rounded developer, you need to learn and master the basics of plain JavaScript without the frameworks. Once you have this foundation, the pathway will become easier for you to learn a framework built on top of JavaScript, such as React.

# [Writing your first Javascript code](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-with-javascript/supplement/KvDEo/writing-your-first-javascript-code)

In this reading, you'll learn about comments in JavaScript. Additionally, you'll learn about the semi-colon in JavaScript: what it does and why it is used. You will then download a browser if you don't have one installed and run your first piece of JavaScript using the Console.

## Comments in JavaScript

I've chosen comments as the starting point for two reasons:

1. Their syntax - the way comments are written is easy to understand.
2. Writing comments can empower you as a developer.

First, I'll explain the syntax, and after that, I'll discuss why being able to write comments is so empowering.

### Comments in JavaScript: the syntax

There are two varieties of comments in JavaScript:

1. Single-line comments
2. Multi-line comments

A single-line comment is created when you add two forward-slash characters one after the other, without spaces.

```JS
// this is a comment!
```

Anything that follows a single-line comment in JavaScript is ignored by the browser.

This means that, essentially, you can write any kind of text, code, characters, emojis, whatever - and the browser will ignore it.

A multi-line comment, as its name says, spans for several lines of code and is created with a forward slash and a star. For example:

```JS
/*
this
is
a
multi-line
comment
*/
```

You can also use the multi-line comment syntax on a single line of code, as follows:

```JS
/* this is a multi-line comment on a single line */
```

## Why writing comments is empowering

In this course, it is assumed that you've never written a single line of JavaScript code.

With this assumption in mind, consider the effects of what you've just learned, that is, the effects of learning how to write comments in JavaScript:

1. You can now freely express your ideas about any code that you write.
2. You can add comments to any code that already exists.
3. Those comments can be intended for your future self, or for colleagues on your development team.

So, comments are empowering because they facilitate communication with your future self or with your team members, allowing you to ask questions about the code, mark the code as "to do", or as "to improve", or just simply explain what a given piece of code does.

Additionally, you can even comment out some working code in a JavaScript file - to prevent it from running.

Effectively, comments allow you to "switch off" pieces of JavaScript code.

There can be many reasons for that:

1. Trying to understand how a given piece of code works.
2. Testing different solutions to a coding problem - while not having to delete existing code.
3. Debugging - trying to pin-point why your code is broken or behaving unprediticably.

## The semi-colon in JavaScript

In the English language, the fullstop or period - the `.` character - is used to separate thoughts into sentences.

By clearly separating thoughts with the fullstop, you avoid being misunderstood.

In JavaScript, the semi-colon - the `;` character - has a similar purpose: it is used to clearly delimit parts of the code from some other parts of the code.

### Automatic Semi-Colon Insertion (ASI)

Interestingly, the browser has a feature known as "Automatic Semi-colon Insertion" - meaning, it does a pretty good job of "filling in the blanks" in case there is a missing semi-colon where there should be one.

Effectively, what that means for developers is that most of the time, it makes no difference if a semi-colon is added or not, since the browser is likely to figure it out anyway.

That's why some developers say that you shouldn't bother with adding semi-colons at all.

However, other developers argue that it's better to use it wherever it's needed - for the sake of clarity.

The truth is that most of the time, you can think of adding semi-colons in JavaScript as optional - and somewhat of a stylistic preference.

## A note on using the console in the developer tools in your browser

As already mentioned earlier on in this course, one of the reasons why JavaScript is so popular is because it's so approachable.

To get started with JavaScript, all you need is a browser. In this course I'll be using Google Chrome.

Once you've installed the browser and run it, right-click on the currently active web page and click the Inspect command on the right-click contextual menu.

This will open the Developer Tools and then you can click on the Console tab to open the console, or alternatively, pressing the ESC key will toggle on and off the console regardless of the currently active Developer Tools panel.

You can type any JavaScript command you like into the DevTools console.

## **If you need to type multiple lines of code before you run them, make sure to press the SHIFT + ENTER shortcut key to get onto the next line.**

Notice the distinction between pressing the `ENTER` key to run the JavaScript code you've typed, versus pressing the `SHIFT + ENTER` shortcut to move onto the next line of code (rather than running the code you've already typed up).

This is all that you need to get started writing JavaScript code!

In the upcoming lessons, feel free to follow along in either of two ways:

1. Using the VS Code editor and the Code Runner extension as previously described
2. Using the Chrome browser itself, and running the code inside the DevTools console as described in this reading

## Output a greeting into the console

Now that you know how to get to the Developer Tools' Console tab, let's now use it to run your first piece of real JavaScript code.

In Chrome, with the Developer Tools open, click into the empty space in the console tab, just to the right of the blue > character. You should see a blinking vertical line (also referred to as "the cursor"). The cursor indicates that you can type into the console.

If you type valid JavaScript code, it will be executed, meaning: it will be processed and it might result in some kind of output.

You'll now use the `console.log` function to output the words "Hello, World".

To do so, type the following command into the console:

```JS
console.log("Hello, World");
```

![[OE_8TdFzQXOP_E3RcwFzXg_8b49e78ded554d63bc325a5d05fc13e1_console-log-authors-own-screenshot.png]]

If you've done everything as instructed, the words "Hello, World" should be output in the console.

Here's another, more complex command, to show you that the `console.log` command comes with a number of tricks.

For example, did you know that you can style the output in the console?

In this code snippet, there are a few additions: the font size is different and the color is blue:

```JS
console.log("%cHello, World", "color: blue; font-size: 40px");
```

![[QQw1d181QE-MNXdfNUBPhA_d303233cd4db486482f2f753479f74e1_console-log-with-percentage-c-authors-screeshot.png]]

If you copy-paste this piece of code, or perhaps, simply type it into the console, once you press the `ENTER` key to run it, you'll get the words "Hello, World" output to the console. This time, however, the color of the letters will be blue, and the font size will be 40px. So, you've just learned a nice trick with the console.

If you add the `%c` right after the `"` character, you can then style the console output by adding the `,` character after the second `"`, and then, inside another pair of `"` and `"` characters, use valid CSS code to style the words you want to output in the console.

The reason for showing you this little trick was to hopefully get you motivated to practice writing various words into the `console.log` command, and to use your CSS skills to change the styling of these words in the console output. That way, you might find it fun to practice this newly acquired skill - and learning and fun always go nicely together.

## Output multiple words into the console

To output multiple words into the console, you can join them using the `+` character, formally known as the "concatenation operator" when we're joining pieces of text, or the "addition operator", for performing the mathematical operation of adding two numbers.

Here is an example of joining three separate pieces of text: `console.log("Hello " + "there, " + "World")`. The output of this command will be: _Hello there, World_.

Here is an example of outputting three separate pieces of text using the , character instead:

`console.log("Hello ", "there, ", "World")`

The output of this command will still be: _Hello there, World_.

# [Variables ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-with-javascript/lecture/A0YPr/variables)

When you start programming in JavaScript, it helps to think of an empty JavaScript program as the first level of a sandbox game. The world is still empty, but there's some underlying structure to it to build on. That structure needs to be there so that you can write custom JavaScript code in the first place.

That structure needs to be there so that you can write custom JavaScript code in the first place. However, besides the underlying structure, a new JavaScript program is like a blank slate for you to build on. 

```JS
var person;
```

```JS
var person = "John";
person;
```

```Console
'John'
```

```JS
console.log("Hello", person)
```

```Console
Hello John
```

```JS
var greeting = "Hello"
console.log(greeting, person)
```

```Console
Hello John
```

```JS
greeting = 'hi'
person = 'James'
console.log(greeting, person)
```

```Console
hi James
```

11. Reassign the value stored in `catSound` to the string `"meow"`.
12. Console.log the variable `petCat`, then the string `"now says"`, then the variable `catSound`.    

Make sure to output all your variables. Feel free to play.

# [Declaring variables (solutions)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-with-javascript/supplement/fBBxl/declaring-variables-solutions)

Here are the solutions to the previous exercise, which was to practice declaring variables.

**Please note:** The solutions presented here use single quotes and double quotes interchangeably to delimit pieces of text. This is done on purpose to illustrate that both ways of representing text are possible and acceptable so that you are aware of it.

## Task 1 solution to: Declare a new variable named `petDog` and give it the name `Rex`.

```JS
var petDog = 'Rex';
```

## Task 2 solution to: Declare a new variable named `petCat` and give it the name `Pepper`.

```JS
var petCat = 'Pepper';
```

## Task 3 solution to: Console log the `petDog` variable.

```JS
var petDog = 'Rex'; // Task 1 solution
console.log(petDog);
```

## Task 4 solution to: Console log the `petCat` variable.

```JS
var petCat = 'Pepper'; // Task 2 solution
console.log(petCat);
```

## Task 5 solution to: Console.log the string `"My pet dog's name is: "` and the `petDog` variable.

```JS
var petDog = 'Rex'; // Task 1 solution
console.log("My pet dog's name is: " + petDog);
```

Please note that in this specific example, because the text in line 2 contains a single quote within it, you should use double quotes to surround the whole piece of text. Otherwise, JavaScript will return an error. We will cover this issue in more detail later.

## Task 6 solution to: Console.log the string `"My pet cat's name is: "` and the `petCat` variable.

```JS
var petCat = 'Pepper'; // Task 2 solution
console.log("My pet cat's name is: " + petCat);
```

Please note that in this specific example, because the text in line 2 contains a single quote within it, you should use double quotes to surround the whole piece of text. Otherwise, JavaScript will return an error. We will cover this issue in more detail later.

## Task 7 solution to: Declare another variable and name it `catSound`. Assign the string of `"purr"` to it.

```JS
var catSound = "purr";
```

## Task 8 solution to: Declare another variable and name it `dogSound`. Assign the string of `"woof"` to it.

```JS
var dogSound = "woof";
```

## Task 9 solution to: Console.log the variable `petDog`, then the string `"says"`, then the variable `dogSound`.

```JS
var petDog = 'Rex'; // Task 1 solution
var dogSound = "woof"; // Task 8 solution
console.log(petDog, "says", dogSound);
```

## Task 10 solution to: Console.log the variable `petCat`, then the string `"says"`, then the variable `catSound`.

```JS
var petCat = 'Pepper'; // Task 2 solution
var catSound = "purr"; // Task 7 solution
console.log(petCat, "says", catSound);
```

## Task 11 solution to: Reassign the value stored in `catSound` to the string `"meow"`.

```JS
var catSound = "purr"; // Task 7 solution
catSound = "meow";
```

## Task 12 solution to: Console.log the variable `petCat`, then the string `"now says"`, then the variable `catSound`.

```JS
var petCat = 'Pepper'; // Task 2 solution
var catSound = "meow"; // Task 11 solution
console.log(petCat, "now says", catSound);
```
